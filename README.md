This is a clone of the Dotabuff website, popular statistics parsing website for online multiplayer game DotA 2. I have added some additional features such as the counterpicker and esports tracker.

This project has following features:
    <ul>
        <li>Parse matches statistics</li>
        <li>Parse players statistics</li>
        <li>Parse heroes statistics</li>
        <li>Parse items statistics</li>
        <li>Parse esports matches and players</li>
        <li>Find the best hero pick for the selected match or for any given lineups</li>
    </ul>
